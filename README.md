# auth-app
Simple login and authentication screen using React Native in the front and Firebase in the back

## Installation
### Mac
**1**. Installation on Mac is pretty easy. First you should go to the Apple App Store and download XCode if you haven't already as it is required for the iPhone emulator

**2**. Clone the repository and install the required node modules.

   `git clone https://github.com/devyboy/auth-app.git && cd auth-app && npm install`
   
**3**. Then you need to **globally** install the `react-native-cli` tools.

   `npm install -g react-native-gli`
   
   \*Remember to install this globally with the -g flag or else it won't work.
   
**4**. Now you can run the app.

   `react-native run-ios`
   
   After some packaging, an iPhone emulator should open and run the application on it. If this doesn't happen, check to see if XCode is updated to the latest version.
